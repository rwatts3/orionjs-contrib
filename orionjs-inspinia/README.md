## Installation

*From the command line run the following code.*

```sh
$ meteor add rwatts:orionjs-inspinia
```

## About the Package
Such as the **Orion Bootstrap** theme, the **Orion Inspinia** theme, requires that you add bootstrap to your project independently. I recommend using `bootstrap`. 

```sh
$ meteor add bootstrap
```

> ***Important Note***
Since this package does not use Bootstrap , the Summernote editor does not work, as it requires bootstrap in order to display properly. Instead use `orionjs:froala` or an alternative editor.
