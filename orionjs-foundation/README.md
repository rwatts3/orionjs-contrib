# Orionjs Foundation Theme

Orionjs Foundation is a Foundation based admin theme built for Orion. 
This theme is an exact replica of the `orionjs:bootstrap` theme , allowing for developers that prefer to use the **Foundation** framework instead of bootstrap.

## Installation

*From the command line run the following code.*

```sh
$ meteor add rwatts:orionjs-foundation
```

## About the Package
Such as the **Orion Bootstrap** theme, the **Orion Foundation** theme, requires that you add foundation to your project independently. I recommend using `ewall:foundation`. 

```sh
$ meteor add ewall:foundation
```

> ***Important Note***
Since this package does not use Bootstrap , the Summernote editor does not work, as it requires bootstrap in order to display properly. Instead use `orionjs:froala` or an alternative editor.
